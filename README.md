# Contactlab Loader

** Work in progress **

Similar to a [Tag manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_management_system),
this script allows Contactlab clients to insert a single JavaScript tag in their
web pages with a single client ID. The script will asynchrounsly load other tags
and configurations based on the client ID.
