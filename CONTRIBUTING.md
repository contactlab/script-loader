# Contributing

**Contacthub SDK Browser** is open source software; we welcome, encourage and
support contributions from the community. Please take a moment to read these
guidelines before submitting changes.

## Code style

We use [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to enforce a shared set of style
conventions. Make sure running `npm run lint` does not produce any warning
before submitting a pull request.

## Testing

If you add a new functionality, please add some tests for it. If you modify an
existing functionality, make sure that all existing tests are still passing and
update them where needed.

## Branching and pull requests

We encourage a fork & pull approach to contribute to the codebase. As a
guideline, please follow this process:

 1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
 2. Create a topic branch for the change:
    - Always branch from **master**.
    - Please ensure the branch is clearly labelled as a feature or fix.
 3. Make the relevant changes.
 4. [Squash](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) commits if necessary.
